I would like to share my experience of using various social media platforms and which one is my prefeered one.


Nowadays, there are many Social media platforms available such as youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify, and TikTok - just to name a few. I believe these platforms have played a significant role to reveal valuable and entertaining content to others; especially during the pandemic, when we all were in lock down these platforms helped us
in staying connected with friends and families, and educating ourselves on various topics, or in fact, keeping us updated on what is happening around the world.

I must say, I spend quite a good amount of time on various social media platforms. I do use Spotify - to listen to my favourite tracks while working out, Facebook - to stay connected with my friends and to follow various events in the area or the Facebook marketplace to look for great deals,
Twitter - to follow global news and events, Linkedin - to find the right professional and business connection
and of course, My favourite in all, youtube - that helps keep me entertained, and educated on various topics of my choice.

To me, every platform has its essence and different business model, so it is all about what's your preferences on what you want to do or watch. For example, when I want to buy some second-hand/used items,
The Facebook marketplace is the best place to start with. Sometimes you can get really good deals on the products.

On the other hand, If I want to look for more enriching and reliable content youtube is the best place to look for.

Additionally, if I want to listen to popular music from popular albums or singers, certainly Spotify is the place to go.

Except for the platforms listed above, I do use Twitter sometimes, at least 10-15 mins a day. It is the best
place to look for current news on any National and world events. Be it sports news, entertainment news or any major breaking news, you will always be informed and aware of the things going on around the world.

Now let me explain my experience and journey as a Regular YouTube viewer. I remember I joined YouTube back in 2010, that time the platform was not as popular as it is today. The sole reason I started using the platform is because of its Educational content. I must say it helped me greatly in understanding various challenging topics with extreme ease. The best part of learning from youTube is that on any chosen topic you can find videos from multiple content creators. That means more varieties and different perceptions of different people on the same topic.

Other than that, many of my additional skills such as Cooking, assembling computers, gardening, and exercising - I have learnt
from youtube. I am amazed by the way they teach Step by Step process, which is easier to follow especially for Beginners.

About how often I use Youtube, honestly, several times a day, in fact, at any time of the day, I will have at least
1-2 browser tabs on my laptop have some youtube video playing. On average the usage is 3-4 hours a day, which means 20-25 hours a week.
That is quite a lot compared to my use of any other social media platform.

I like the YouTube platform for a whole variety of reasons. Firstly, It has a huge and rich source of Learning and Educational Resources. The Best Platform for visual learners, especially those like me,
who perceive knowledge quickly if it is demonstrated Visually.

Secondly, it does have varieties of entertainment resources such as comedy videos, short movie clips, innovative content, contest videos, and parodies. All from various content creators on a range of topics.

Lastly, it provides an opportunity to meet like minded people using interactive live stream sessions, community sharing and comments that result in a more engaging open conversation and discussion

However, the platform does have negative impacts on the netizens.

First and foremost, there is lots of uncensored content such as abusive videos, adult videos, predatory behaviour,
or content that promotes harmful or dangerous behaviour, which is certainly not appropriate for all age groups especially
when the end user is children.

In a recent incident, I read that a guy learned how to make a bomb by watching youtube videos. That scared the hell out of me. How come such extremely dangerous content is accessible to everyone worldwide.

Additionally, there are lots of online harassing and bullying incidents that are quite evident on these platforms.

To control that, I would say there should be strictly enforced censorship rules, and those who do not stick to these rules should face strict punishment or charge with severe fines.

Regarding the type of content, I watch on youTube. I am a Software Engineer by profession, so mostly I watch videos to learn more about different technologies. Interviews and sensation stories of
successful developers. I also watch the news on YouTube, which helps me keep up-to-date about world events or any ongoing crisis details.

Moreover, the type of content I mostly watch varies based on my need. I prefer to watch a few comedy videos or sitcoms or favourite movie clips when I want to relax and enjoy myself. If I want to enhance my culinary skills, cooking channels are a great place to look at.

Also, If I want to acquire any essential skill to perform day-to-day work in my house, YouTube has a huge list of videos on "HOW TO DO <SOMETHING>" involving step-by-step process. Neat and easy to follow.

Another aspect of youtube that plays a vital role is the likes, comments, and views on the posted videos. All of these have immense information that we could use. For example, the no. of views shows how popular the video is. Going through comments helps in engaging more in the conversation with fellow viewers. The comments section usually has lots of answers to the common questions people may have about the posted video.

Regarding Sponsored content on youtube, I did find it immensely useful as it is endorsed by the person whom you follow, that is a content creator. the product they are promoting is well tested so mostly
it acts as a recommendation for me. On top of that, you will get some discount on the items if you use the referral link,
so a win-win case for both viewers and the content creator.

Regarding company-sponsored advertisements on YouTube, I generally do not like those ads. They usually try to feed you with
the ads of top brands, based on your search history, and it gets annoyed when the same advertisement constantly interrupts you every 5-10 minutes while you are watching the videos which add up irritation sometimes.

Talking about my experience of buying any endorsed products, It is excellent and top-rated. I did buy many items. One of them was non-toxic cookware utensils, recommended by one of my favourite food bloggers. I loved it. Not only did I get a great discount on those items but also the quality of the product was top-notch. As I said, the content creator will only recommend something which they already have tried and tested.

- And, indeed I would prefer to buy again, I have been on this platform for so long, and there are certain youtube channels which I follow for the last 5-7 years, I do trust them, and whatever recommendation they would give, it will surely be the genuine one.

Talking of my TV watching habits, I watch it several times a week. I have a Smart TV. So it is easier to stream content from various Streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Netflix, and Hotstar when you want to watch your favourite shows or binge watch any movies
or TV on a bigger and brighter screen.

Regarding the type of shows I prefer to watch, I love watching tv shows or movies of different genres (/ˈZHänrə/) such as horror, action, comedy, and sci-fi - these are my all-time favourite. I usually watch TV from an average of 3-4 hours a week to 10+ hours a week.

We do have a cable connection as well from Roger. And the only time I use it is when I want to watch any live match
or if sometimes I am in the mood to do nothing. In that case, scrolling through different TV channels while lying on the sofa is quite entertaining.

That is pretty much it about my social media platform usage preferences and experience.
